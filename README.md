# Kharaf: Your Farming Companion

## Description
Kharaf is an Image Classification project designed to assist in the classification of Date types, Maturity, and Grade, as well as the detection of diseases affecting Palm Trees. The project primarily utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.

## Features
- **Date Classification:** Identifies different types, maturity stages, and grades of dates through image classification using CNNs.
- **Palm Tree Disease Detection:** Utilizes CNN-based algorithms to identify diseases affecting Palm Trees from images.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** Utilized for building and training Convolutional Neural Networks.
- **Plotly Dash:** Employed for the web application interface.

## Usage
Currently, the project is undergoing deployment. Instructions on how to use the project, including installation steps, training the CNN models, running the web application, and utilizing the image classification and disease detection features will be provided once the deployment phase is completed.
